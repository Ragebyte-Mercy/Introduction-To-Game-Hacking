# Introduction-To-Game-Hacking

Open The SSL File to begin viewing the source of the actual base.

the current design of the tool uses the nugget package "Dark UI"

Dark UI is not required, this is just something i use to make the GUI clean, fast, and effecient.

currently memory.dll.x86 is installed, ( nugget package ) if the game you plan on hacking is not a 32 bit game, 

please uninstall x86 and install memory.dll.x64 instead.

this base, can be used for majority of games, this is just a quick template. Hope this helps
